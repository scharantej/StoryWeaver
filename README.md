 ## Flask Application Design for a Choose Your Own Adventure Comic Book Website

### HTML Files

#### 1. `index.html`
- Serves as the landing page of the website.
- Presents the user with a brief introduction to the choose your own adventure story and provides a link to start the adventure.

#### 2. `adventure.html`
- The main page where the user progresses through the story.
- Displays the current scene or situation, along with multiple options for the user to choose from.
- Each option leads to a different path in the story, and the user's choices determine the outcome.

#### 3. `end.html`
- The final page reached when the user completes the adventure.
- Displays the ending of the story based on the choices made throughout the adventure.

### Routes

#### 1. `/`
- The route for the landing page (`index.html`).
- Serves the `index.html` file when the user accesses the website's root URL.

#### 2. `/adventure`
- The route for the main adventure page (`adventure.html`).
- Serves the `adventure.html` file when the user starts the adventure or makes a choice.
- Takes user input (the chosen option) as a query parameter and uses it to determine the next scene or situation.

#### 3. `/end`
- The route for the ending page (`end.html`).
- Serves the `end.html` file when the user reaches the end of the adventure.
- Takes user input (the choices made during the adventure) as query parameters and uses them to determine the appropriate ending.

### Additional Considerations

- The HTML files should include appropriate styling and layout to create an engaging and visually appealing comic book-style adventure.
- The Flask application can be further enhanced by adding features like user authentication, session management, and database integration to track user progress and choices.
- Error handling and input validation should be implemented to ensure a smooth user experience.
